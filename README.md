This is still an unfinished project. The Mask_and_CNN file contains the results up until now, with an accuracy of ~80%. The current best model is a relatively shallow CNN net work. The transfer learning using pre-trained Resnet18 also showed promising results. However, the other methods did not achieve any significant results. The other files are codes used during training, intermediate works, and ideas that are still being tested.

The project's main bottleneck is the size and *quality* of dataset, which is not uploaded due to its size unfortunately.The plan in the next stage is to annotate more data and create a dataset of 2~3k images, and create a new model that distinguish all vehicles without sunshades or with noticable damages. These identification could be then used for more customized advertising.
